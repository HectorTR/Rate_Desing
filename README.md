# Rate Desing
 
The structure of electricity charges desing and the optimal revenue requirement for utilities in California using the computational power of GridLAB-D based on the granularity and load diversity.

The initial step will be to reproduce the current electricity rates based on:
-Demand Charges 
-Time of use (TOU)
-Real time pricing

The subdivision charges: transmission, distribution, and generation must be detailed for each rate structire defined. 

Using the capabalities of GridLAB-D for load circtuit simulation the readings from a meter or a group of meters will provideall the necessary and sufficient information to accurately represent the billing. 

# Objectives 

Use GridLAB-D to optimize the design rate structure providing a optimal billing selection that will satisfy the revenue requirement for utilities. 

# Challenges 
 
How to measure the sensitivity in load flexibility in customers. How to determine the proper billing allocation that will closely represnt the nilling mix in a given circuit. 

# Planning 

1. Document, study, and describe mathematically how the billing happens in California. 

2. Implementation of the different electricity rates in GridLAB-D. 

3. Optimize the billing mix for optimal revenue requirement at the best rate for customers.
